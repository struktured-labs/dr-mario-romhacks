Dr. Mario Training Mode v5
===========================

A ROM hack that transforms the pause screen into a study mode for
practicing Dr. Mario strategies and analyzing virus/capsule positions.

FEATURES
--------
- Playfield remains fully visible when paused (no blackout)
- "STUDY" text displayed at the top of the screen instead of "PAUSE"
- All game elements (viruses, capsules, bottle) stay visible for analysis

CHANGES FROM ORIGINAL
---------------------
- PPU rendering enabled during pause state
- Pause text repositioned to top of screen
- Custom "STUDY" text replaces "PAUSE" using new tile graphics

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
-----------------
- Dr. Mario throwing animation sprite disappears during pause
- Dancing virus sprites (level intro) disappear during pause
- Falling capsule not visible during pause (frozen in place)

These limitations exist because certain sprite routines are shared
between the pause system and menu screens. Disabling them would break
the game selection menu.
